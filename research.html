<h1 id="our-research">Our Research</h1>

<p>The Doucet Lab investigates how proteins move, interact, and function at the molecular level.<br>
We combine <strong>structural biology</strong>, <strong>protein engineering</strong>, <strong>biophysics</strong>, and <strong>AI-assisted modeling</strong> to explore the fundamental mechanisms that drive catalysis, regulation, and biomolecular recognition.<br>
Our goal is to generate new biological insight and to design improved enzymes, nanobodies, and biomolecular tools with potential applications in biotechnology, health, and food systems.</p>

<h2 id="1-structural-biochemistry--protein-dynamics">1. Structural biochemistry &amp; protein dynamics</h2>

<p>Many proteins rely on subtle conformational fluctuations to control activity, specificity, and molecular recognition.<br>
Our lab studies these dynamic processes using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>NMR spectroscopy</strong> (relaxation dispersion, chemical shift perturbations, titrations)</li>
  <li>
<strong>X-ray crystallography</strong> for high-resolution structural information</li>
  <li><strong>Mutagenesis and directed evolution</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Computational modeling and molecular dynamics</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We apply these approaches to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understand how conformational networks regulate catalysis in RNases and related enzyme superfamilies</li>
  <li>identify conserved dynamic “hotspots” that underlie specificity</li>
  <li>reprogram enzyme activity toward desired pathways</li>
  <li>study SH3-domain recognition and peptide-mediated signaling</li>
</ul>

<p>This work provides deeper insight into how structure and motion cooperate to shape biological function.</p>

<h2 id="2-spase--ai-guided-protein-engineering">2. SPASE — AI-guided protein engineering</h2>

<p><strong>SPASE (Soluble Protein Analog Selection Engine)</strong> is our in-house, AI-assisted design platform.<br>
It integrates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>sequence design</strong> (ProteinMPNN and related models)</li>
  <li>
<strong>stability and solubility prediction</strong> (Protein-Sol, Aggrescan3D, etc.)</li>
  <li>
<strong>structure prediction</strong> (ESMFold, AlphaFold3)</li>
  <li><strong>automated scoring and fast variant prioritization</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>SPASE enables us to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>design more stable, soluble, and expression-friendly proteins</li>
  <li>generate informative structural analogs for NMR and crystallography</li>
  <li>guide mutational scans and computational protein rescue</li>
  <li>rapidly test hypotheses about conformational switching and catalytic pathways</li>
</ul>

<p>SPASE also supports our collaborations in <strong>enzyme redesign</strong>, <strong>nanobody optimization</strong>, and <strong>biocatalyst engineering</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="3-therapeutic-nanobodies--enzyme-inhibitors">3. Therapeutic nanobodies &amp; enzyme inhibitors</h2>

<p>Our lab develops <strong>nanobodies</strong> to study and modulate protein function.<br>
We apply structural and biophysical characterization to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identify binding epitopes</li>
  <li>map conformational selection vs. induced fit</li>
  <li>quantify affinity and kinetics</li>
  <li>understand mechanism of inhibition at atomic resolution</li>
</ul>

<p>Current directions include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>anti-hANG nanobodies</strong> to block pathogenic ribonuclease activity</li>
  <li>
<strong>nanobody-based conformational traps</strong> to regulate enzyme motion</li>
  <li>structure-guided design of inhibitors targeting dynamic hotspots</li>
</ul>

<p>Nanobodies also serve as crystallization chaperones and NMR stabilizers for challenging protein targets.</p>

<h2 id="4-biomolecular--food-systems-characterization">4. Biomolecular &amp; food systems characterization</h2>

<p>We lead a growing research program on <strong>molecular fingerprinting of complex food matrices</strong>, with a focus on <strong>Québec maple syrup</strong> in collaboration with academic, industrial, and municipal partners.</p>

<p>We use:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>high-field NMR metabolomics</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Fast-GC chromatography</strong></li>
  <li><strong>IR and MIR spectroscopy</strong></li>
  <li><strong>chemometric modeling and machine learning</strong></li>
  <li><strong>microbial and environmental profiling</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Our goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>characterize the molecular basis of <strong>maple syrup terroir</strong>
</li>
  <li>understand chemical signatures associated with <strong>quality defects</strong>
</li>
  <li>identify microbial drivers of seasonal and geographic variability</li>
  <li>develop predictive tools for production, classification, and authentication</li>
</ul>

<p>This highly interdisciplinary program bridges <strong>biochemistry</strong>, <strong>microbiology</strong>, <strong>chemometrics</strong>, and <strong>food science</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="5-collaborative-platforms-and-infrastructure">5. Collaborative platforms and infrastructure</h2>

<p>Our work is supported by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <strong>MIMC structural and biophysical platform</strong> (INRS)</li>
  <li>national and international synchrotron collaborations</li>
  <li>analytical and spectroscopy facilities (NMR, IR, chromatography, MS)</li>
  <li>high-performance computing resources for AI-based design and MD simulations</li>
</ul>

<p>We work closely with partners in academia, industry, municipalities, and government to translate molecular understanding into practical applications.</p>
