# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-microscope" %} Research

Our lab investigates how proteins work, evolve, and can be redesigned for new molecular functions.  
We combine **structural biology**, **AI-guided protein engineering**, **biophysical characterization**, and **food & biomolecular chemistry** to uncover mechanisms of action and create innovative biotechnological tools.

## <a id="structural-biochemistry"></a>Structural biochemistry & enzyme engineering

We study how conformational dynamics, molecular flexibility, and active-site architecture shape enzyme function.  
Our work integrates:

- **NMR spectroscopy** (¹H–¹⁵N HSQC, relaxation dynamics, titration mapping)  
- **X-ray crystallography** for high-resolution structural snapshots  
- **Molecular modeling and mutagenesis** to probe catalytic determinants  

We apply these approaches to biologically important enzymes, including ribonucleases, angiogenin, and carbohydrate-binding proteins such as galectins.

## <a id="spase"></a>SPASE – AI-guided protein design

**SPASE (Soluble Protein Analog Selection Engine)** is our in-house AI-assisted protein design platform. It integrates:

- **ProteinMPNN** for sequence redesign  
- **Stability and solubility predictions** (e.g. protein-Sol, Aggrescan3D)  
- **Structure prediction** using models such as ESMFold or AlphaFold  
- Automated ranking and filtering to identify **experimentally tractable** variants  

We use SPASE to design improved enzyme variants, stabilize difficult proteins, explore evolutionary trajectories, and engineer novel molecular functions.

## Nanobody engineering & molecular therapeutics

We develop and characterize nanobodies targeting:

- **Human angiogenin (hANG)** – with applications in cancer biology and ribonuclease regulation  
- **Galectin-7 (GAL-7)** – involved in epithelial homeostasis, cancer progression and immune signaling  

Our pipeline includes phage-display nanobody discovery, NMR epitope mapping, biophysical affinity measurements, and structure-guided redesign.  
These nanobodies act as inhibitors, conformational traps, and crystallization or NMR chaperones for challenging targets.

## <a id="food-systems"></a>Biomolecular & food systems characterization

We apply high-resolution spectroscopy and chemometrics to complex biological matrices.  
In collaboration with academic, industrial and municipal partners, we focus on:

- **Maple syrup molecular fingerprinting** using NMR, Fast-GC and IR spectroscopy  
- Identification of **terroir signatures**, **quality defects** and **chemical markers**  
- Machine-learning models for classification and authenticity assessment  

This interdisciplinary program bridges environmental microbiology, analytical chemistry and biomolecular modeling to understand how ecosystems shape food chemistry.

## Tools & infrastructure

Our work is supported by state-of-the-art NMR facilities, crystallography and biophysics platforms, analytical chemistry infrastructure, and high-performance computing resources for AI-driven protein engineering.  
We also maintain the **SPASE server**, which hosts internal pipelines for automated design and analysis.
