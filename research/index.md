# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-microscope" %} Research

Our lab investigates how proteins work, evolve, and can be redesigned for new molecular functions.  
We combine **structural biology**, **AI-guided protein engineering**, **biophysical characterization**, and **food & biomolecular chemistry** to uncover mechanisms of action and create innovative biotechnological tools.

Our research programs span three major axes:

## Structural biochemistry & enzyme engineering

We study how conformational dynamics, molecular flexibility, and active-site architecture shape enzyme function.  
Our work integrates:

- **NMR spectroscopy** (¹H–¹⁵N HSQC, relaxation dynamics, titration mapping)  
- **X-ray crystallography** for high-resolution structural snapshots  
- **Molecular modeling & mutagenesis** to probe catalytic determinants  

We apply these approaches to biologically important enzymes, including ribonucleases, angiogenin, and carbohydrate-binding proteins such as galectins.

## SPASE – AI-guided protein design

**SPASE (Soluble Protein Analog Selection Engine)** is our in-house AI-assisted protein design framework.  
It integrates:

- **ProteinMPNN** for sequence redesign  
- **Stability and solubility predictions** (protein-Sol, Aggrescan3D, etc.)  
- **Structure prediction** using **AlphaFold**, **ESMFold**, or custom generative models  
- Automated ranking and filtering to identify **experimentally tractable** variants  

We use SPASE to design improved enzyme variants, stabilize difficult proteins, explore evolutionary trajectories, and engineer novel molecular functions.

## Nanobody engineering & molecular therapeutics

We develop and characterize nanobodies targeting:

- **Human angiogenin (hANG)** — with applications in cancer biology and ribonuclease regulation  
- **Galectin-7 (GAL-7)** — involved in epithelial homeostasis, cancer progression, and immune signaling  

Our pipeline integrates:

- Phage-display–derived nanobody discovery  
- NMR epitope mapping  
- Biophysical affinity measurements  
- Structural analysis and computational redesign  

These efforts support therapeutic development and fundamental understanding of regulatory protein networks.

## Biomolecular & food systems characterization

We apply high-resolution spectroscopy and chemometrics to complex biological matrices.  
Our collaborative research includes:

- **Maple syrup molecular fingerprinting** using NMR, Fast-GC, IR spectroscopy  
- Identification of **terroir signatures**, **quality defects**, and **chemical markers**  
- Machine-learning models for classification and authenticity assessment  

This interdisciplinary program integrates environmental microbiology, analytical chemistry, and biomolecular modeling to understand how ecosystems shape food chemistry.
