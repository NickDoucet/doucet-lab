# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-microscope" %} Research

Our lab investigates how proteins work, evolve, and can be redesigned for new molecular functions. 

We combine **structural biology**, **AI-guided protein engineering**, **biophysical characterization**, and **food & biomolecular chemistry** to uncover mechanisms of action and create innovative biotechnological tools.

## IMCM / MIMC – Molecular Interactions and Materials Characterization platform

We also manage and perform closely integrated research with the **IMCM / MIMC (Molecular Interactions and Materials Characterization) platform** at INRS.  

This platform provides academic and industrial access to advanced structural biology, biophysics, and analytical tools for probing:

- **Protein-ligand and protein–protein interactions**  
- **Conformational dynamics and folding landscapes**  
- **Biomolecular stability, aggregation and self-assembly**  

We work with the platform to design and execute rigorous experimental pipelines, from biophysical screening to high-resolution structural analysis, in support of both fundamental and applied research in small-molecule, materials, protein, and food/biomolecular chemistry.

## Research programs at a glance

## <a id="structural-biology"></a>Structural biology & protein engineering

We study how conformational dynamics, molecular flexibility, and active-site architecture shape enzyme function.  
Our work integrates:

- **NMR spectroscopy** (multidimensional NMR, relaxation dynamics, titration mapping)  
- **X-ray crystallography** for high-resolution structural snapshots  
- **Molecular modeling and mutagenesis** to probe catalytic determinants  

We apply these approaches to biologically important enzymes, including ribonucleases and carbohydrate-binding proteins such as galectins.

## <a id="spase"></a>SPASE – AI-guided protein design

**SPASE (Soluble Protein Analog Selection Engine)** is our in-house AI-assisted protein design platform. It integrates:

- **ProteinMPNN** for sequence redesign  
- **Stability and solubility predictions** (e.g. Protein-Sol, Aggrescan3D)  
- **Structure prediction** using models such as ESMFold or AlphaFold  
- Automated ranking and filtering to identify **experimentally tractable** variants  

We use SPASE to design improved protein variants, stabilize difficult scaffolds, explore evolutionary trajectories, and engineer novel molecular functions.

## Nanobody engineering & molecular therapeutics

We develop and characterize nanobodies targeting:

- **Human RNases** – with applications in cancer biology and ribonuclease regulation  
- **Human Galectins** – involved in epithelial homeostasis, cancer progression and immune signaling  

Our pipeline includes phage-display nanobody discovery with partners, NMR epitope mapping, biophysical affinity measurements, and structure-guided redesign.  
These nanobodies act as inhibitors, conformational traps, and crystallization or NMR chaperones for challenging targets.

## <a id="food-systems"></a>Biomolecular & food systems characterization

We apply high-resolution spectroscopy and chemometrics to complex biological matrices.  
In collaboration with academic, industrial and municipal partners, we focus on:

- **Maple syrup molecular fingerprinting** using NMR  
- Identification of **terroir signatures**, **quality defects** and **chemical markers**  
- Machine-learning models for classification and authenticity assessment  

This interdisciplinary program bridges environmental microbiology, analytical chemistry, and biomolecular modeling to understand how ecosystems shape food chemistry.

## Tools & infrastructure

Our work is supported by state-of-the-art NMR facilities, crystallography and biophysics platforms, analytical chemistry infrastructure, and high-performance computing resources for AI-driven protein engineering.  

We also maintain the **SPASE server**, which hosts internal pipelines for automated design and analysis.
