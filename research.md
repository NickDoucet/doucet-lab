# Our Research

The Doucet Lab investigates how proteins move, interact, and function at the molecular level.  
We combine **structural biology**, **protein engineering**, **biophysics**, and **AI-assisted modeling** to explore the fundamental mechanisms that drive catalysis, regulation, and biomolecular recognition.  
Our goal is to generate new biological insight and to design improved enzymes, nanobodies, and biomolecular tools with potential applications in biotechnology, health, and food systems.

## 1. Structural biochemistry & protein dynamics

Many proteins rely on subtle conformational fluctuations to control activity, specificity, and molecular recognition.  
Our lab studies these dynamic processes using:

- **NMR spectroscopy** (relaxation dispersion, chemical shift perturbations, titrations)  
- **X-ray crystallography** for high-resolution structural information  
- **Mutagenesis and directed evolution**  
- **Computational modeling and molecular dynamics**

We apply these approaches to:

- understand how conformational networks regulate catalysis in RNases and related enzyme superfamilies  
- identify conserved dynamic “hotspots” that underlie specificity  
- reprogram enzyme activity toward desired pathways  
- study SH3-domain recognition and peptide-mediated signaling

This work provides deeper insight into how structure and motion cooperate to shape biological function.

## 2. SPASE — AI-guided protein engineering

**SPASE (Soluble Protein Analog Selection Engine)** is our in-house, AI-assisted design platform.  
It integrates:

- **sequence design** (ProteinMPNN and related models)  
- **stability and solubility prediction** (Protein-Sol, Aggrescan3D, etc.)  
- **structure prediction** (ESMFold, AlphaFold3)  
- **automated scoring and fast variant prioritization**

SPASE enables us to:

- design more stable, soluble, and expression-friendly proteins  
- generate informative structural analogs for NMR and crystallography  
- guide mutational scans and computational protein rescue  
- rapidly test hypotheses about conformational switching and catalytic pathways

SPASE also supports our collaborations in **enzyme redesign**, **nanobody optimization**, and **biocatalyst engineering**.

## 3. Therapeutic nanobodies & enzyme inhibitors

Our lab develops **nanobodies** to study and modulate protein function.  
We apply structural and biophysical characterization to:

- identify binding epitopes  
- map conformational selection vs. induced fit  
- quantify affinity and kinetics  
- understand mechanism of inhibition at atomic resolution

Current directions include:

- **anti-hANG nanobodies** to block pathogenic ribonuclease activity  
- **nanobody-based conformational traps** to regulate enzyme motion  
- structure-guided design of inhibitors targeting dynamic hotspots  

Nanobodies also serve as crystallization chaperones and NMR stabilizers for challenging protein targets.

## 4. Biomolecular & food systems characterization

We lead a growing research program on **molecular fingerprinting of complex food matrices**, with a focus on **Québec maple syrup** in collaboration with academic, industrial, and municipal partners.

We use:

- **high-field NMR metabolomics**  
- **Fast-GC chromatography**  
- **IR and MIR spectroscopy**  
- **chemometric modeling and machine learning**  
- **microbial and environmental profiling**

Our goals:

- characterize the molecular basis of **maple syrup terroir**  
- understand chemical signatures associated with **quality defects**  
- identify microbial drivers of seasonal and geographic variability  
- develop predictive tools for production, classification, and authentication

This highly interdisciplinary program bridges **biochemistry**, **microbiology**, **chemometrics**, and **food science**.

## 5. Collaborative platforms and infrastructure

Our work is supported by:

- the **MIMC structural and biophysical platform** (INRS)  
- national and international synchrotron collaborations  
- analytical and spectroscopy facilities (NMR, IR, chromatography, MS)  
- high-performance computing resources for AI-based design and MD simulations

We work closely with partners in academia, industry, municipalities, and government to translate molecular understanding into practical applications.
