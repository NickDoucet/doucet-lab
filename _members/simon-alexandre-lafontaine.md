Simon-Alexandre is a PhD student jointly supervised at **INRS** and the **Université Laval** in collaboration with **Prof. Sylvain Moineau**, a world leader in CRISPR biology.  

His research focuses on the **structural and functional engineering of CRISPR–Cas9 systems**, with the goal of understanding how guide-RNA recognition, target binding and catalytic activation are modulated by protein dynamics and molecular interactions.

His project integrates:

- **Protein engineering** of Cas9 variants  
- **Structural and biophysical characterization** (NMR, modeling, mutagenesis)  
- **Functional assays** to probe DNA targeting and cleavage  
- **Comparative analysis** of natural Cas systems and engineered variants  

Working at the interface of structural biology and microbial immunity, Simon-Alexandre contributes to developing **next-generation CRISPR tools** with improved specificity, stability and functional tunability for biotechnology and genome engineering applications.
