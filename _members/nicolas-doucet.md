Nicolas Doucet obtained his B.S. in biochemistry from Laval University (B.S. Biochemistry, 2000) and successively completed a master's degree (M.S. Biochemistry, 2004) and a doctoral thesis in enzyme engineering with Joelle N. Pelletier at the University of Montreal (Ph.D. Biochemistry, 2007).

After completing a protein NMR postdoctoral fellowship in the Department of Chemistry at Yale University (with J. Patrick Loria, 2007-2010), he joined the faculty at INRS in 2010, where his research focuses on protein structure, dynamics, and molecular design.  

His group combines high-resolution NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, biophysics, and AI-guided protein engineering to understand how proteins work and to create new enzymes, nanobodies, and biomolecular tools for health and biotechnology.
