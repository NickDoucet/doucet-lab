Nicolas Doucet obtained his B.Sc. in Biochemistry from Laval University (2000), followed by an M.Sc. (2004) and a Ph.D. in enzyme engineering (2007) at the University of Montreal under the supervision of Joelle N. Pelletier. He then completed a postdoctoral fellowship in protein NMR spectroscopy at Yale University with J. Patrick Loria (2007–2010), where he developed expertise in biomolecular dynamics and NMR-based mechanistic analysis. He joined the faculty of the Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS) in 2010, where he is now Professor of Structural Biology and Protein Engineering.

His research program focuses on understanding how protein structure, dynamics and molecular recognition shape biological function, and on leveraging these principles to design new enzymes, nanobodies and biomolecular tools. His group integrates high-resolution NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, biophysics, computational modeling, and AI-guided protein engineering, notably through SPASE (Soluble Protein Analog Selection Engine), an in-house molecular design platform he developed to accelerate sequence redesign, stability prediction and structure analysis.

At INRS, Nicolas is deeply involved in research infrastructure. He is a core contributor to the IMCM/MIMC (Molecular Interactions and Materials Characterization) platform, supporting advanced structural and biophysical analyses for academic and industrial partners, and he plays key roles in provincial and national networks such as PROTEO, GlycoNet, and collaborative programs in food chemistry and biomolecular characterization. His team co-leads major interdisciplinary initiatives, including projects on maple syrup molecular fingerprinting, food and biomolecular systems chemistry, and collaborative research on RNase biology, galectins, enzyme mechanics, and nanobody design with partners from academia, industry and municipalities.

Nicolas has received substantial research support from agencies including NSERC, Mitacs, FRQNT, and institutional platforms, and he has acted as co-chair of the NSERC Discovery Grant Evaluation Committee, as well as a jury member for Québec Science’s “Découvertes de l’année”. He maintains active collaborations with colleagues across the molecular biosciences community — including structural biology, microbiology, analytical chemistry, and biophysics — and his trainees have received numerous competitive awards (CIHR, NSERC, FRQNT, Arbour Foundation, international travel fellowships).

His lab continues to advance fundamental and applied protein science by combining mechanistic understanding with intelligent molecular design, with applications ranging from therapeutic protein engineering to nanobody development, food chemistry, and biotechnological innovation.
