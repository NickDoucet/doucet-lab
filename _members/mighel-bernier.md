Mighel is an M.Sc. student co-supervised by **Nicolas Doucet** and **Prof. Marc-André Gauthier** (INRS), working at the interface of structural biology, chemical biology and biomolecular engineering.  

His research focuses on the design and characterization of **multivalent nanobody complexes** targeting **human RNases** and **galectins**, with the goal of modulating molecular recognition, stability and functional interactions.

His project combines:

- **Nanobody engineering** and multivalent scaffold design  
- **X-ray crystallography** for structural analysis  
- **Protein biophysics** (binding affinity, stability, ligand interactions)  
- **Structure–function analysis** of RNase and galectin complexes  

Through this interdisciplinary work, Mighel aims to understand how multivalency influences biomolecular recognition and to develop next-generation nanobody architectures for biochemical and biotechnological applications.
