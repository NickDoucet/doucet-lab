Quynh is a Mitacs-funded postdoctoral researcher working in collaboration with an industrial partner to investigate **human ribonucleases (RNases)** and develop **nanobody-based modulators**.  

Her work combines multidimensional **NMR spectroscopy**, protein biophysics, structural modeling, and engineering of nanobody scaffolds to dissect RNase function, stability and ligand recognition.  

She also contributes to the lab’s platform for molecular design by integrating structural and biophysical insights into the development of next-generation therapeutic nanobodies.
