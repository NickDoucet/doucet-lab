Alex is a PhD student working at the interface of **AI-guided protein design** and **structural glycobiology**.  
He contributes to the development and refinement of **SPASE**, the lab’s in-house protein design engine, by integrating sequence design models, structure prediction tools and automated ranking pipelines.  
His research also focuses on the **structural and functional characterization of human galectins**, where he combines NMR spectroscopy, mutagenesis and computational modeling to dissect molecular determinants of ligand recognition and protein-protein interactions.
