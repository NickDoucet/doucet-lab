# The Doucet Lab – Structural Biology, Protein Engineering & Biomolecular Characterization

Welcome to the **Doucet Lab** at the INRS – Armand-Frappier Health & Biotechnology Research Centre (Laval, Canada).  
We investigate **protein structure, dynamics, and function**, and we develop innovative biochemical, biophysical, and AI-driven tools to engineer enzymes and characterize complex biological systems.

Our core expertise spans:

- **NMR spectroscopy** & **X-ray crystallography** for high-resolution structural and dynamic analysis  
- **Protein engineering**, **nanobody development**, and **enzyme redesign**  
- **Artificial intelligence-guided protein design**, including our in-house platform **SPASE**  
- **Biomolecular fingerprinting of food matrices** using NMR, Fast-GC, IR spectroscopy & chemometrics

## Equity, Diversity & Inclusion

Our group values and actively promotes diversity. We welcome trainees from all backgrounds and are committed to maintaining an inclusive and collaborative environment where every team member can thrive.  
We strongly support the participation of women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and other underrepresented groups in science, and encourage all motivated trainees to join our research programs.

# Research Highlights

## Protein Dynamics & Catalysis (Core Theme)

{% capture text %}

A central question drives much of our work:

> **Can enzyme engineering benefit from the controlled modulation of protein motions?**

Using NMR relaxation dispersion, mutagenesis, and evolutionary design, we examine how dynamic networks shape catalysis and how they can be reprogrammed to generate new functional properties.

Our studies show that related enzymes often retain **conserved dynamic signatures**, even when their sequences diverge—suggesting that flexibility encodes evolutionary information that can guide enzyme redesign.

## SPASE – AI-Driven Protein Design Platform

{% capture text %}

**SPASE (Soluble Protein Analog Selection Engine)** is our in-house AI-assisted protein engineering pipeline.  
Developed in the Doucet Lab, SPASE integrates:

- **ProteinMPNN** for sequence design  
- **Protein-Sol & Aggrescan3D** for solubility and aggregation prediction  
- **ESMFold** for rapid structure prediction  
- A customizable scoring framework for stability, expressibility, mutational tolerance & dynamic signatures  

SPASE enables the **rapid in silico generation of protein variants**, accelerating experimental screening and guiding downstream biophysical characterization.  
It is now applied across several projects, including nanobody optimization, enzyme redesign, and comparative modeling of human ribonucleases.

## Biomolecular & Food Systems Characterization

{% capture text %}

Beyond classical structural biology, our lab leads a growing research program in **food chemistry, biomolecular fingerprinting, and chemometric classification**.  
In collaboration with partners across Québec, we develop molecular and microbiological tools to characterize:

- **maple syrup chemical composition** (NMR, Fast-GC, MIR/IR spectroscopy)  
- **terroir signatures and regional markers**  
- **defect detection and early quality indicators**  
- **microbial and environmental drivers of product variability**  

Using high-resolution spectroscopy and multivariate statistics, we generate **molecular fingerprints** of food matrices and build predictive models to classify origin, detect adulteration, and understand biochemical pathways underlying flavor development.

This program integrates structural biochemistry, analytical chemistry, microbiome analysis, and AI-based pattern recognition.
