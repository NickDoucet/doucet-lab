# Doucet Lab – Structural Biochemistry & Enzyme Engineering

Welcome to the **Doucet Lab** at the INRS – Armand-Frappier Health & Biotechnology Research Centre, Université du Québec (Laval, Canada).  
We study **protein dynamics and enzyme engineering**, with a particular focus on how conformational motions shape catalysis and can be harnessed to design better biocatalysts.

Our research combines:

- **NMR spectroscopy** and **X-ray crystallography** for high-resolution structural and dynamic insights  
- **Directed evolution** and **rational mutagenesis** to reprogram enzyme activity and specificity :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- **Biochemical and biophysical characterization** (enzyme kinetics, molecular biology, molecular modeling) to connect structure, flexibility, and function

## Equity, Diversity & Inclusion

Our lab **values and actively promotes diversity**, welcoming students and researchers from all backgrounds, identities, and experiences.  
We are committed to fostering an inclusive, respectful, and collaborative environment where everyone—regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, or socioeconomic background—can thrive.  
We strongly support the participation of women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and other underrepresented groups in science, and we encourage all motivated trainees to join us in advancing discovery. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

## Research highlights

{% capture text %}

Despite remarkable progress in protein engineering and design, creating new and efficient enzymatic activities often remains laborious and time-consuming. Our work asks a central question:

> **Can enzyme engineering benefit from the controlled modulation of protein motions?** :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  

By integrating NMR relaxation dispersion, mutagenesis, and evolutionary design, we probe long-range dynamic networks in enzymes and explore how tuning these motions can reshape catalysis.

Using several enzyme systems (including ribonucleases and other model enzymes), we investigate:

- how conserved residues and local structural environments define motional and functional properties,  
- how related enzymes retain similar dynamic signatures within a shared fold,  
- and how this **structure–function** and **flexibility–function** information can be translated into the design of new molecular biocatalysts. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

The lab is embedded within the **INRS – Armand-Frappier Health & Biotechnology Research Centre**, a graduate-level research institute dedicated exclusively to advanced training and high-impact science. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  

Our trainees benefit from:

- access to state-of-the-art structural biology and biophysics facilities,  
- strong links to the **Pasteur Network** and international collaborators,  
- and a supportive, interdisciplinary environment for developing as independent scientists.
