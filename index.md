# Doucet Lab – Structural Biochemistry, Enzyme Engineering & Biomolecular Characterization

Welcome to the **Doucet Lab** at the INRS – Armand-Frappier Health & Biotechnology Research Centre (Laval, Canada).  
We investigate **protein structure, dynamics, and function**, and we develop innovative biochemical, biophysical, and AI-driven tools to engineer enzymes and characterize complex biological systems.

Our core expertise spans:

- **NMR spectroscopy** and **X-ray crystallography** for high-resolution structural and dynamic analysis  
- **Protein engineering**, **nanobody development**, and **enzyme redesign**  
- **Artificial intelligence–guided protein design**, including our in-house platform SPASE  
- **Biomolecular fingerprinting of food matrices** using NMR, Fast-GC, IR spectroscopy, and chemometrics

## Equity, Diversity & Inclusion

Our group values and actively promotes diversity. We welcome trainees from all backgrounds and are committed to maintaining an inclusive and collaborative environment where every team member can thrive.  
We strongly support the participation of women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and other underrepresented groups in science, and we encourage all motivated trainees to join our research programs.

## Selected media highlights

- **“Ancestral ribonucleases back in motion for evolutionary-dynamics guided protein design”** – spotlight article in *Trends in Biochemical Sciences* (2024)  
- Radio-Canada science segments on COVID-19, viral structure, and protein behavior (*Les années lumière*, *Moteur de recherche*)  
- Coverage of our work on conserved protein dynamics and SH3 specificity in enzyme superfamilies in various scientific news outlets  

## Research highlights

### Protein dynamics & catalysis

A central question drives much of our work:

> Can enzyme engineering benefit from the controlled modulation of protein motions?

Using NMR relaxation dispersion, mutagenesis, and evolutionary design, we examine how dynamic networks shape catalysis and how they can be reprogrammed to generate new functional properties.

### SPASE – AI-guided protein engineering

**SPASE (Soluble Protein Analog Selection Engine)** is our in-house AI-assisted protein engineering pipeline. It integrates state-of-the-art sequence design, solubility and aggregation prediction, and structure prediction tools to generate protein variants that are more stable, soluble, and experimentally tractable.

### Biomolecular & food systems characterization

We lead a growing research program in **food chemistry, biomolecular fingerprinting, and chemometric classification**.  
In collaboration with Québec partners, we develop molecular and microbiological tools to characterize maple syrup composition, terroir signatures, quality defects, and microbial drivers of product variability.

### Training environment

The Doucet Lab is part of a graduate-only research institute dedicated to high-impact science. Trainees benefit from access to advanced structural biology, analytical chemistry, and biophysics platforms, as well as interdisciplinary collaborations and industrial partnerships.
