Welcome to the **Doucet Lab** at the Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS) – Université du Québec (Montréal, Canada).  
We investigate **protein structure, dynamics, and function** and develop innovative biochemical, biophysical, and AI-driven tools to engineer enzymes and characterize complex biological systems.


Welcome to the **Doucet Lab** at the Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS) – Université du Québec (Montréal, Canada).  
We investigate **protein structure, dynamics, and function** and develop innovative biochemical, biophysical, and AI-driven tools to engineer enzymes and characterize complex biological systems.

Our core expertise spans:

- **NMR spectroscopy** and **X-ray crystallography** for high-resolution structural and dynamic analysis  
- **Protein & enzyme engineering**, **nanobody redesign**  
- **Artificial intelligence–guided protein design**, including our in-house server platform SPASE (Soluble Protein Analog Selection Engine)
- **Biomolecular fingerprinting of food matrices** using NMR and chemometrics

## Equity, Diversity & Inclusion

Our group values and actively promotes diversity. We welcome trainees from all backgrounds and are committed to maintaining an inclusive and collaborative environment where every team member can thrive.  
We strongly support the participation of women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and other underrepresented groups in science and encourage all motivated trainees to join our research programs.
