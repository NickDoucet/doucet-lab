# Doucet Lab – Structural Biochemistry, Enzyme Engineering & Biomolecular Characterization

Welcome to the **Doucet Lab** at the INRS – Armand-Frappier Health & Biotechnology Research Centre (Laval, Canada).  
We investigate **protein structure, dynamics, and function** and develop innovative biochemical, biophysical, and AI-driven tools to engineer enzymes and characterize complex biological systems.

Our core expertise spans:

- **NMR spectroscopy** and **X-ray crystallography** for high-resolution structural and dynamic analysis  
- **Protein engineering**, **nanobody development**, and **enzyme redesign**  
- **Artificial intelligence–guided protein design**, including our in-house platform SPASE  
- **Biomolecular fingerprinting of food matrices** using NMR, Fast-GC, IR spectroscopy, and chemometrics

## Equity, Diversity & Inclusion

Our group values and actively promotes diversity. We welcome trainees from all backgrounds and are committed to maintaining an inclusive and collaborative environment where every team member can thrive.  
We strongly support the participation of women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and other underrepresented groups in science and encourage all motivated trainees to join our research programs.

## Selected media highlights

- **“Ancestral ribonucleases back in motion for evolutionary-dynamics guided protein design”** – spotlight article in *Trends in Biochemical Sciences* (2024)  
- Radio-Canada science segments on COVID-19, viral structure, and protein behavior (*Les années lumière*, *Moteur de recherche*)  
- Coverage of our work on conserved protein dynamics and SH3 specificity in enzyme superfamilies in various scientific news outlets
